# IoTeX DeWi Demo

A decentralized WiFi internet connectivity network (DeWi) built on IoTeX as a fully verifiable and composable Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN).

This demo aims to create a fully functional DePIN project using real-world devices. It will demonstrate the integration of various IoTeX modules to construct a verifiable and reliable DePIN solution.

## Discalimer

This demo is a live content, it is intended to evolve and grow when more features and improvements are released on IoTeX. The demo is intended for educational purpose only: many components and security features are missing, or rely on early releases of the IoTeX protocols, therefore it should not be intended for prduction.

## Quick Start
